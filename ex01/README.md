# Exercise 01 — First use of package

Format the current date/time using the `time` and `datetime` modules so the output matches the requested layout.

## Task

1. Implement `format_ft_time.py` to calculate the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, and print two representations:
   - A human-readable value with commas and four decimal places, followed by the same value in scientific notation.
   - The current date formatted as `Oct 21 2022` (three-letter month abbreviation, day, year).
2. Keep the print order exactly as shown in the example; the first line should describe the seconds, the second line should show the formatted date.

## Running the script

```
python ex01\format_ft_time.py
```

## Expected format (exact numbers will differ):

```
Seconds since January 1, 1970: 1,666,355,857.3622 or 1.67e+09 in scientific notation
Oct 21 2022
```
